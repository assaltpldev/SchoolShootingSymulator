# SchoolShootingSymulator

This game wasn't made to spread and promote violence but to de-stress, for sure it may prevent people from taking weapons and shooting out their shool if they can do it safe and in game.

We just don't want another massacre in the real school, and thats why this game was made.

Warning dont play this game if you get offended eaisly.

Its currectly on Alpha So there might be some inssues. 
Game based on Source Engine 2013.
